    <h1>line-height property</h1>
    <p>
        HTML line spacing — the vertical space between two lines of text within a paragraph — isn't the most exciting thing in the UX design world, but it matters more than you think. This styling element involves Experience Strategy and Interaction Design — two of the four UX design quadrants used to create an incredible user experience. But it goes much deeper than that.<br/>Here's a quick lowdown on HTML line spacing: It has the power to make a text more or less readable. Line-height has an enormous impact on readability, and if users can't read content, they're going to hit the "back" button or exit the app. It's super-important for accessibility, and with ever-increasing legal standards and requirements that govern this practice, you need to use the correct spacing or risk alienating users. Good line spacing makes or breaks the success of a website or app. It's that simple.
