        A font family name that matches a font that is embedded on the page or available on the user's system.
        A series of family names, separated by commas, which can include a generic family name
        If multiple family names are used, the browser will select the first one it finds either embedded on the page using @font-face or installed on the user's operating system.
        For font-family there is no specific default or initial value; the initial value always depends on the browser and/or operating system.
