    <h1>Sass Variables</h1>
    <p class="para1">
        CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is
        where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance,
        and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.
    </p>
    <p class="para2">
        Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (.scss) is used most commonly. It's a superset of CSS, which means all
        valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The indented syntax (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly
        braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available
        in both syntaxes.
    </p>
    <p class="para3">
        Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file
        that you can use in your website.
    </p>
    <p class="para4">
        The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass
        to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to.
        For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss,
        and compile that file to output.css.
