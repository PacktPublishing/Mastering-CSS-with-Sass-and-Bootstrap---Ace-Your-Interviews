    <h1>Configuring Sass in Project</h1>
    <p>
        CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is
        where a preprocessor can help. Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins, inheritance,
        and other nifty goodies that help you write robust, maintainable CSS.
 
        Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file
        that you can use in your website.
