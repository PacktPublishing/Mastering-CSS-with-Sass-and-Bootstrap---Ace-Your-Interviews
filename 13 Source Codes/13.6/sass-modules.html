    <h1>Sass Modules</h1>
    <p class="text1">
        The @use rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple
        stylesheets together. Stylesheets loaded by @use are called "modules". Sass also provides built-in modules full
        of useful functions.
    </p>
    <p class="text2">
        You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule
    </p>
    <p class="text3">
        This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions
        in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in
        your compiled output!
